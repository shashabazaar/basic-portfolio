If you have a problem if no one else can help and if you can find them maybe you can hire The A-Team. As long as we live its you and me baby. There ain't nothin' wrong with that. Here he comes Here comes Speed Racer. He's a demon on wheels. Texas tea.

And we know Flipper lives in a world full of wonder flying there-under under the sea. Knight Rider: A shadowy flight into the dangerous world of a man who does not exist. Got kind of tired packin' and unpackin' - town to town and up and down the dial. Sunday Monday Happy Days. Tuesday Wednesday Happy Days. Thursday Friday Happy Days.Saturday what a day.
